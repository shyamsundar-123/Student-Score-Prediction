## Overview  
This is a *Supervised Machine Learning* project that uses *Simple Linear Regression* to analyze and predict student scores based on the number of hours they study.  

## Dataset  
- *Source:* The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle (or can be manually created).  
- *Features:*  
  - *Hours:* Number of study hours.  
  - *Scores:* Marks obtained.  

## Installation  
1. *Clone the repository:*  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Student-Score-Prediction.git
   cd Student-Score-Prediction
   
## Usage
- The script trains a model using a given dataset.
- Users can input custom study hours to predict expected scores.

## Model Explanation
- **Algorithm Used:** Simple **Linear Regression.**
- **Training:** The model is trained on historical student score data.
- **Prediction:** Given new input (study hours), it predicts the expected score.

## Results
- The model successfully predicts student scores with reasonable accuracy.
- **Example Prediction:**
    - **Input:** 5 hours of study
    - **Predicted Score:** ~50 marks

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
